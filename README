# Smart Inventory Management System

## Overview
The **Smart Inventory Management System** is a web application designed to help users manage inventory efficiently using natural language processing (NLP). The system allows users to add, update, and query item information through intuitive text or voice commands. Built with a Flask backend and Vue.js frontend, the application ensures seamless interaction and robust performance.

- **Natural Language Input**: Add and update inventory using commands like "Add 50 units of Amul butter" or "Update 4kg stock of rice".
- **Command Parsing**: Interpret natural language inputs for inventory operations.
- **Inventory Database**: Store and manage inventory details.
- **User Authentication**: Secure the application with JWT-based user authentication.
- **Real-time Updates**: View inventory changes in real-time using WebSockets or server-sent events (SSE).
- **Reports and Analytics**: Generate insightful reports on inventory trends and usage.

## Tech Stack
- **Frontend**: Vue.js
- **Backend**: Flask
- **Database**: SQLite
- **NLP Library**: SpaCy
- **Authentication**: Flask-JWT-Extended
